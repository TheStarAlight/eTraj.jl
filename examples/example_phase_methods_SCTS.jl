# === example_phase_methods_SCTS.jl ===
#
# To investigate the difference between the phase methods QTMC and SCTS, we emplopyed the QTMC and SCTS as the phase methods during the trajectory simulation.
# This is the SCTS task.
#
# To run the example, a julia intepreter (version ≥ 1.7) with the *SemiclassicalSFI* package (and its dependencies) installed is required.
#
# Usage: place example_phase_methods_SCTS.jl in the working directory, and execute:
#   julia -t <n_threads> example_phase_methods_SCTS.jl
# where the `n_threads` should be replaced with the desired number of threads allocated for julia.
#
# Note:
# 1. This example takes a very long time (~10h each task for 4 threads) to finish.
# 2. In this example, the 3D momentum spectrum is collected, which is very memory-consuming, consider using fewer threads.
# 3. A 16-thread task is much less efficient than a 4-thread task and consumes much more memory. Therefore, it's suggested to use fewer threads (e.g., 4) per task.
