# === example_attoclock.jl ===
#
# With the aim of studying the influence of non-adiabatic effects on the attoclock signal, we employ ADK, SFA-AE and SFA to provide the initial conditions of the electrons, and perform trajectory simulations.
#
# To run the example, a julia intepreter (version ≥ 1.7) with the *SemiclassicalSFI* package (and its dependencies) installed is required.
#
# Usage: place example_attoclock.jl in the working directory, and execute:
#   julia -t <n_threads> example_attoclock.jl
# where the `n_threads` should be replaced with the desired number of threads allocated for julia.
